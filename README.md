# D&D&Me

This is an Android application developed in Android Studio that allows users to find and create groups to play Dungeons & Dragons (or other similar games) with.

## Usage

Once a user registers after first time use, their profile is automatically created and saved (user remains logged in unless they manually log out) and the app navigates to their profile screen. The profile is editable. A user will not be matched with any other users unless they first fill out the questionnaire. Once the questionnaire has been filled, the user will receive valid matches to other users.
